### Gameplay
#### Creative Mode
Here, you can load in a `CSV File` with the following format:
```csv
PLANET_NAME | PLANET_MASS | PLANET_POSITION_X (IN AU) | PLANET_POSITION_X (IN AU) | PLANET_VEL_X (m/s) | PLANET_VEL_Y (m/s) | PLANET_RADIUS
```

And watch your configuration of a solar system come to life!

#### Play Mode
* You get to control a rocket. Different rockets have different masses and max accelerations. They also burn fuel at different rates.
* Your goal is to navigate the rocket to the goal planet (The green one)
* But here's the catch: You can only **accelerate or decelerate**.
* Exploit the gravitational fields of the surrounding planets to your advantage.
* Try to do so before the fuel runs out!

* It is game over if you crash into other planets, or take too long.
